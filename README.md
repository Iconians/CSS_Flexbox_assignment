- **In the terminal (locally):**
  1. `mkdir project-name` then `cd project-name`
  2. `git init`
  3. Create your files, then: `git add .` → `git commit -m "Initial commit"`
  4. `git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git`
  5. `git branch -M main` (if needed)
  6. `git push -u origin main`
